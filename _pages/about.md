# About

Hi! Iâ€™m Shaoqin Tang, a PhD candidate in Strategy at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research explores the intersection of technology and corporate strategy, with a focus on how firms leverage user communities, digital platforms, and automation technologies to create and capture value.

In my work, I investigate governance strategies that firms use to influence behaviors within open-source communities and digital platforms. Additionally, I examine how automation and AI technologies address frictions in the knowledge production process, enhancing knowledge sourcing and reshaping strategic opportunities for firms.
