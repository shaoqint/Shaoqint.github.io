# About

Hello! Iâ€™m Shaoqin Tang, a PhD candidate in Strategy at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research sits at the crossroads of technology and corporate strategy, investigating how firms utilize user communities, digital platforms, and automation/AI technologies to drive value creation and capture.

I examine the governance strategies firms employ to shape behaviors within open-source communities and digital platforms. Additionally, my work explores how automation and AI can address frictions and enhance the efficiency of the knowledge production process.
